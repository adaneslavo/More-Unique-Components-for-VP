				The Andelsbevægelse (Danish Cooperative Movement) was a means of economical organization under leadership of consumer- or producer-controlled corporations, where each individual member owned a part of the corporation. The type of organization was popular in the farming industry and in consumer organizations in Denmark from the 1790s to the 1960s. The members of the corporations sought to share the economic stress of producing or buying goods, and divided the eventual end-year financial surplus amongst themselves. The type of ownership rules varied greatly between individual corporations, as some divided the financial risk equally, while others gave more power to the most financially involved individuals.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, two new movements hit Denmark. One was a successful attempt to reclaim moors in central and western Jutland for farming, which was mostly sandy land abandoned in the 14th century as a result of the Black Plague, but in many cases good for potatoes. This movement was initiated by Hedeselskabet (the Heath Association). Equally important was an influx of agricultural imports to Great Britain, Denmark's primary market for grains, from a rapidly industrializing United States, which caused not only a sharp drop in prices, but an agriculture crisis throughout Europe in the final decade of the 19th century. This affected the income of many Danish farmers and the result was a change in production from grain to dairy products and meat. When a farmer couldn't sell his grain, he fed it to his cows and pigs.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The change in production resulted in a need for dairies and slaughterhouses. A Danish minister visited England and studied the Rochdale system of co-operatives, which he then brought back to Denmark. The only way to pay for such massive investments was for a large group of farmers to share the cost and risk between them, thus creating the cooperative dairies and slaughterhouses. The new situation implied that farmers would buy cheap grain from Russia and feed it to their livestock, selling milk, butter, eggs and meat for a much higher price. This movement also resulted in the creation of both the Danish Bacon and Danish Lurpak Butter brands. The cooperative movement also resulted in a series of co-op stores known as Brugsen, which were under the administration of The Danish Consumers Co-operative Society. The stores kept a large share of the Danish consumer goods market. It merged with the similar retail chains in Norway and Sweden in January 2002, to form Coop Norden.

				The Agora was the marketplace and beating heart of the ancient Greek city-states. Originally used as meeting places for announcements and a muster point for soldiers, Agoras gradually became centers of commerce and trade. Artisans and merchants could sell their wares either in the open, or along the covered walkways which surrounded the field, known as the stoa. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Often the site of intense philosophical and political discussion, the Agora have been immortalized as the proving ground of renowned philosophers, writers, storytellers, and orators. Disciplines such as Sophism, Skepticism, Cynicism and Stoicism can trace their roots back to the politicking and squabbles of the Grecian Agora.

			<Text>The Huns' origins remain shrouded in mystery, but one clue to their possible connection to the ancient scourge of China, the Xiongnu, is their rule by an Alti Cur, or Six-Horns Council. The Alti Cur were a small council of nobles, the most powerful men within the Hunnic empire besides the emperor himself. Each was seated according to their rank and standing with the emperor, with the Empreror's favorite seated to his immediate right, signifying the north and east.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			An emperor's legitimacy depended heavily on the tributes he could exact from the surrounding kingdoms. It is surmised that insufficient tributes from the Chinese and other client steppes tribes may have contributed to the decline and disappearance of the Xiongnu in East Asia, only for them to burst once more onto the world stage in eastern Europe.</Text>

				The "Great and Most Fortunate Navy", the Spanish Armada, was a fleet of 130 ships constructed expressly for the invasion of England to overthrow the Reformist tyrant, Elizabeth I. The fleet was one of the largest ever seen in Europe, raised at great expense by Philip II in retribution for England's break from the Catholic Church, the perceived illegitimacy of Elizabeth I (born from Henry VIII's second marriage), Elizabeth's execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, and English support for the Dutch revolt against Spain. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Spanish ships were outnumbered, but they easily outgunned their smaller English counterparts. In the end, however, it was not firepower, but speed and maneuverability which won the day, allowing the small English vessels to harry the lumbering Spanish Juggernaut, sinking 10 ships. When finally forced to retire to Spain, a navigational error blew the Armada off-course and onto the Irish coast, where fierce storms dashed the ships against the rocks. When the Armada at last reached Spain only 67 of the original 130 ships remained, full of sickly, starving, and demoralized sailors. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The lessons of the Spanish Armada informed naval strategy and design for the next two centuries. Cannons and ranged action had now overtaken boarding and ramming as the primary methods of attack; sinking, rather than capturing, was now the priority. With this stunning victory, England had wrested naval dominance from Spain, a lead they would maintain until the rise of the United States in WWII. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

			<Text>Often thought of as ceremonial and military implements first, perhaps the greatest contribution of elephants to human society has been as beasts of burden. Elephants are prized as a labour force even within today's lumber camps for their ability to haul the dense teak lumber found only within Burma and Thailand. The power of a fully grown elephant is matched only by its grace, as the animals can navigate difficult and uneven terrain impassable by carts and tractors, while carrying loads far in excess of other animals. The use of elephants in logging also has had unintentional benefits to the health of forests, with their delicate command of the forest trails reducing the potential damage of logging roads.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			The jobs of Southeast Asia's working elephants have come under threat within the past few decades with the mechanization of logging. Elephants and their mahouts have been forced to look for work in tourism and religious festivals, jobs which elephants find terribly stressful. </Text>

				The Swedish Bad Stuga (bath cabin), or Bastu, is a small cabin designed as a bathing and dry heat spa. A stove or furnace heats the room to 75-100°C (167–212 °F) before patrons enter, where they will recline and sweat. Bastus are a social affair; places for discussion and relaxation with family and friends, but in ancient times were also places for food curing and childbirth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Many cultures around the world have independently created their own 'sweat bath' cultures, including Aztec temazcalli, Roman thermae, Korean jjimjilbang, and the sweat lodges of many North American tribes. It is not known where or when Scandinavian sweat baths were first created, but it was well before the Christianization of Scandinavia, as evidenced by their ubiquity throughout medieval Europe. By the time written descriptions of Scandinavian sweat baths were being made, Nordic countries had created varied and distinct cultures surrounding these baths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The health benefits of heat baths are many and varied. Sessions have been shown to relieve cold symptoms and increase pain thresholds. They also help with rheumatic pain and fatigue, and may even reduce the risk of dementia. Prolonged use of a sauna has been linked to reduced male fertility, however, and heat baths should never be enjoyed while under the effects of alcohol.

				A tug is a pole with circularly arranged horse or yak tail-hairs of varying colors arranged at the top. Originally a symbol of the Mongol Empire, it was later adopted in by the Turkic khanates, as well as the Ottoman Empire. It was also adopted by Slavic cavalry in the 18th century, who called the banners 'Bunchuk', and is still used by some units of the Polish military. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				Usage of the horse tail is symbolic because of the central importance of horses in Mongol life. A white-haired banner is used as a peacetime symbol, while the black banner was for wartime. The original white banner disappeared early in history, but the black banner survived as the repository of Genghis Khan's soul. The Mongols continued to honor the banner, building a monastery with the special mission of flying and protecting the black tug banner. However, in 1937 the black banner disappeared amidst purges of Mongol nationalists, monks, and intellectuals. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The Nine White banners came into renewed significance in Mongolia after democracy was adopted in the early 1990s as a symbol of the traditional Mongolian state, replacing the previous communist flags. The modern Mongolian nine white banners are kept in the Government Palace in Ulaanbaatar; the modern Mongolian black banners are kept in the Ministry of Defense.

				A Barbican is a fortified outpost or archery tower, forming part of a city’s outer defense. The towers were often situated outside the main line of defenses with a clear line of fire towards the city’s gates, and connected to the city walls via a walled road called the ‘neck’. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				
				The most well-known barbican was built in Kraków in 1498-1499 during the reign of Jan Olbracht. It was inspired by two other Barbicans in Torun (1429) and Chelm (1449), and motivated by the danger posed by Encroaching Ottoman and Wallachian forces. The Warsaw barbican was erected in 1540 in place of an older gate to protect Nowomiejska Street and almost immediately became an anachronism serving no practical purpose. With the improvement in siege tactics and artillery in the 15th century, barbicans had largely lost their significance. The Warsaw barbican was used in the defense of the city only once, during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1656, when it had to be recaptured from the Swedes by the polish army.

				The Cacadores were the elite light infantry of the Portuguese army in the 18th and 19th centuries. The divisions were famed for their marksmanship and their brown coats, one of the first attempts at military camouflage. After a Portugal's sound defeat and occupation by Napoleon, the English intervened on behalf of their ally to rally and reorganize a joint war to retake the country. The British general William Beresford, as part of his reforms, formed the Cacadores to fill a role analogous to the German jaeger or American ranger divisions. Under this combined military, the Cacadores helped in reclaiming Portuguese independence and distinguished themselves as the "fighting cocks" of the Portuguese army until the units were eventually dissolved in the military reforms of 1911.

				Buffalo Pounds were large constructions built by many Plains Tribes for the entrapment and killing of Buffalo. Large herds of bison were corralled and funneled into the pound, a sturdy circular ring of hides and wood, where tribesmen could throw spears and other missile weapons from the safety of the walls to take the powerful beasts down. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Buffalo were a staple food source on the North American Plains, but hunting such large animals was difficult without horses or sturdy weapons. With the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of the horse and musket, hunting on the Great Plains was changed forever. Widespread adoption of the horse meant Native American tribes could travel great distances and attack bison herds with impunity. The good times would not last, however, as Europeans encroached upon this way of life. Increasingly, the Great Plains were converted into farms and pastures for American homesteaders. The American bison was driven to the brink of extinction by a combination of habitat loss, industrial-scale hunting, and culling intended to starve the indigenous population. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Today, American buffalo have recovered, but their range has been greatly limited to a few national parks. Commercial farming and sport hunting continues, but the bison are unlikely to ever return to their historical numbers.

			<Text>The Chasquis were the messengers of the Inca empire. They were in charge of carrying the quipus, messages and gifts up to 240 km per day through the chasquis relay system, a sort of Pony Express for the horseless Inca. In addition to their physical fitness, the Chasquis were well-educated in order to be able to read and translate the khipus, the Incan knot-based writing system, to each other and higher authorities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Chasquis were dispatched along thousands of miles, taking advantage of the vast Inca system of purpose-built roads and rope bridges in the Andes of Peru and Ecuador. Tambos, or relay stations, were used for the chasquis to stop at and transfer messages to the next chasqui. Each Chasqui carried a pututu, a conch trumpet, which was blown by the chasqui as they neared a Tambo, signalling to a fresh chasqui that one runner was close, so that they could prepare to run.</Text>

				The Barbary Corsairs were pirates and privateers operating off the coast of North Africa. The corsairs became infamous throughout Europe, ranging throughout the Mediterranean, and as far as Iceland, slaughtering livestock and capturing Christians for sale in the slave markets of the Islamic world. The ferocity and frequency of such raids, or "Razzia" was such that much of the coast of Italy and Spain was abandoned for fear of abduction. It is estimated that some 1.25 million people were taken as slaves by barbary pirates between 1530 and 1780 A.D.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				
				The scope of Corsair activity began to diminish in the latter part of the 17th century, as the more powerful European navies started to compel the Barbary States to cease attacking their shipping. However, the ships and coasts of Christian states continued to suffer until the early 19th century. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna in 1814, European powers agreed upon the need to suppress the Barbary corsairs entirely. Occasional incidents continued to occur, including two Barbary wars between the United States and the Barbary States, creating the impetus for the creation of the US Navy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				One of the two elite class of infantry (the other being the Jaguar Warriors) in the Aztec army, the Eagle Warriors were the bravest young men of noble birth and/or those who had taken the most prisoners in battle. Like the Jaguars, the Eagles used the atlatl, bow, spear and macuahuitl (wooden swords set with obsidian shards); unlike the Jaguars, the Eagles decorated their armor with eagle feathers and wore a headdress shaped like the head of an eagle with the beak wide open. And they had a hilltop temple in Malinalco. Upon taking 20 prisoners – intact enough to serve as human sacrifice – a young warrior was eligible to become an Eagle Warrior, no doubt making his family very proud.

				Perhaps the most truly unique aspect of Chinese culture - and the one with the most powerful legacy - is the Confucian examination system with which the Son of Heaven's empire was staffed with civil servants over the best part of two millennia. The Imperial examinations represented an attempt to create an aristocracy of learning, which in itself represent a remarkable advance over the warrior and hereditary aristocracies that dominated in the rest of the world. The Chinese examination system, archaic, laborious and daunting as it may have been, was nevertheless, was a glorious attempt at intellectual meritocracy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Imperial Exams, or Keju, were state organized examinations for candidacy into the Chinese civil service. The examinations amounted to tests of rote memorization of the Five Confucian Classics and required direct quotations on Confucian philosophy and ethics. There were several levels of exams, each conferring differing levels of honor and privelege. A scholar who obtained the highest degree, the jinshi, would have his memory trained to a tremendous degree.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Imperial examinations was abolished in 1890 under pressure by Chinese citizens to reform and modernize the state. As Western universities began to move away from their own classical tradition to embrace economics, engineering and natural science, China's scholarly efforts languished in the ancient literary past. It is unsurprising that the ingenuity that produced the “Four Great Inventions” could not flourish in such a backward-looking intellectual environment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				 “Do you know that we tried an experiment which is unique in the history of the world? We sought to rule this great country not by force, but by wisdom. And for centuries we succeeded.”[NEWLINE]

				Literally meaning "Big Building", the Fale Tele is typical of Samoan architecture. By decree of Tagaloa-lagi, the Samoan creator god, all dwellings were to be of circular design, in imitation of the dome of the heavens and the horizon. Fale Tele were the largest of Samoan buildings, designed to act as meeting places for chief councils as well as family gatherings, celebrations and ceremonies. Regular dwellings were constructed behind the Fale Tele, while a carefully maintained lawn spread in front as a larger gathering and social space for all villagers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Samoan culture’s emphasis on openness is reflected in their architecture, with its circular layouts and no walls. Fales have become emblematic of wider Polynesian architecture, with small fale, or faleo'o, becoming ubiquitous on beaches throughout the Pacific.

				The French Grande Ecole are institutions of higher learning separate from the more conventional university system. These schools are highly selective, taking only the best and brightest French graduates, and barring entry by foreigners. Once accepted, students studying at a Grande Ecole are considered public servants, paying little to no entrance fees and even receiving a monthly government stipend. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The origins of the Grande Ecoles lie in the French Revolution, where several military and technical ecoles normale superieure were established by distinguished French mathematicians and intellectuals. The idea was to open education to individuals based strictly on merit. By the 19th century a number of ecoles had sprung up for a wide array of disciplines including natural sciences, business and the humanities. The Grande Ecoles continue to have a deep impact on French society. Approximately 10% of all Native-born French citizens graduate from these schools, including many of France's most renowned politicians, philosophers, scientists, and executives.

				Haciendas are colonial estates constructed by the Spanish for the administration and extraction of resources from their native subjects. Haciendas were based on grants of property and enterprise, rather than the strict grant of indigenous labor as described by the older Encomienda system. Haciendas were generally large estates, but the nature of the work varied from plantations, to mining, to factories. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The owner of a Hacienda was called a Hacendado, but such wealthy landowners rarely visited or inspected their holdings and preferred to live in nearby cities. Day-to-day operations of a Hacienda were the responsibility of hired managers. Some unusually large and profitable Haciendas were the property of the Roman Catholic Church, causing no small amount of hostility between native laborers and their Christian taskmasters. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Hacienda system was abolished in most countries after the dissolution of the Spanish Empire, but with mixed results. Efforts to break apart the large estates into individual holdings for subsistence farmers led to crushing poverty in some South American nations. In contrast, Latin American and Filipino Haciendas were mostly left intact, though without the same legal standing or permissions of their colonial past.

				Bigger is better, and biggest is best. The super-sized bombards of the late medieval were first used in Western European warfare at the beginning of the 15th century, but it was the Ottomans that would realize the bombard's full potential at the Siege of Constantinople in 1453. Unable to find patronage with the Byzantine emperor, the Hungarian gunfounder Orban sold his services to Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, and began crafting bronze cannons capable of lobbing 1.6 tons of shaped stone more than 2 kilometers. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Transporting such massive weapons took as many as 60 oxen, and required construction or refurbishing of entire road networks before the cannons could be brought to bear against the impregnable Theodosian Walls. Within a day of the opening bombardment, the city which had stood as a fortress of Christendom for a millennium fell, as massive stones smashed the city's defenses to rubble. The sack of Constantinople raged for three days following, and triggered a mass exodus of Greeks into Europe proper. With these Byzantine refugees came a rediscovery of the philosophical and intellectual achievements of Greek culture in Western Europe, planting the seeds of the Renaissance. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Few examples of stone bombards can be found today. These weapons were largely supplanted by iron-ball cannons by the end of the 16th century, but none of those can claim to have single-handedly ended an era.

				A goedendag is a four-foot long club with a spear at its tip, originally used by the militias of Medieval Flanders, notably during the Franco-Flemish War. The weapon was christened "goedendag" by the French, a cognate with the universal Dutch-language greeting "good day". The name is supposedly a reference to the Bruges Matins massacre in 1302, at which the guildsmen of Bruges purportedly took over the city by greeting people in the streets, and murdering anyone who answered with a French accent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The weapon was used to great effect by the guildsmen of Flanders' wealthy cities against the French knights, but exactly how the weapon was used is a source of debate. Contemporary illustrations show it being used as a club, but the contemporary sources describe its first use as a spear to meet a charge, then a club as the enemy was halted. Flemish Goedendags marked the beginning of the end for heavy cavalry in western Europe, and the dawn of an "Infantry Revolution" where common militia were now a credible threat. The stunning victory of common men over foreign tyrants became a wellspring of romantic nationalism for the Low Countries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				Long considered the "Sick Man of Europe", Ottoman power was in decline well before nationalist sentiment took root in the Arab population. When WWI broke out among the European powers and Ottomans set about to crush Arab dissent, the Arabs responded in a popular revolt, declaring a new Islamic empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, began his rebellion in hopes of re-establishing a Hashemite dynasty in Arabia, and led his fellow Arabs in a popular revolt against their Turkish masters in Hejaz. Seeing an opportunity to tie down Ottoman forces in a new front, the British promised to recognize Arab hegemony and heavily subsidize the revolt, sending the now famous T.E. Lawrence as a liaison. The Arabs waged a guerilla war through the desert, crippling Ottoman supply lines and retreating back into the vast desert. With the help of French and English navy, they were able to take several ports along the Mediterranean coast, drawing even more to join their cause.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				With the end of WWI in 1918, and the Ottomans soundly defeated, the Arabs expected the full cooperation of their European allies as they established their new kingdom, but the English and French had other plans. Reneging on their agreement, the French and English secretly, formed the Sykes-Picot Agreement, in which Britain and France agreed to divide the Middle-East amongst themselves into their own respective spheres on influence. This gross betrayal of a trusted ally has soured relations between the Arab states and the West ever since.

			<Text>The Hippodrome was a chariot racing track and the beating heart of Byzantine social and political life. Located immediately next to the palace, the track was built by Constantine shortly after moving his capital to the city. The track was U-shaped, with ten monuments lining the center. Though slightly smaller in footprint than the Circus Maximus in Rome, the Hippodrome was adorned with art and treasures from all corners of the empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Not just a pastime of the rich, the chariot races become the one place where the common people could see and interact with the emperor in a single venue. Commoners often took this opportunity to begin chants for political or religious reforms during sporting events. Four political parties, or demes, existed within Constantinople which each sponsored a different racing team.  These were the Blues, the Whites, the Greens and the Reds. Enormous sums of money were wagered on the rivalries between these teams, which became further heated by the religious, societal and political leanings which each team came to represent.	One such feud in particular would come to overshadow them all: the Nika riots.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] 
			During the reign of Justinian I (an ardent supporter of the Blues), a dispute arose concerning the sentencing of two hooligans who had been arrested for murder from a prior riot. The sentencing of these men unified the Blues and the Greens against Justinian in a terrible mob, and disgruntled nobles seized the opportunity to try to depose him in revenge for the recently levied taxes against the rich Though at first he considered fleeing Constantinople, Justinian rallied his loyal generals to corral the rioters into the Hippodrome, where they were butchered by royal guardsmen and Gothic mercenaries. By the time the Nika riots had ended, half of Constantinople had been burned down and 30,000 rioters and conspirators lay dead; the most violent riot in world history.</Text>

Regimental izinDuna, like the non-commissioned officers of today's army, and yesterday's Roman Centurions, were extremely important to morale and discipline. This was shown during the battle of Isandhlwana. Blanketed by a hail of British bullets, rockets and artillery, the advance of the Zulu faltered. Echoing from the mountain, however, were the shouted cadences and fiery exhortations of their regimental izinDuna, who reminded the warriors that their king did not send them to run away.

				Kabuki is a classical Japanese dance-drama. Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers. The history of kabuki began in 1603 when Izumo no Okuni, possibly a miko of Izumo-taisha, began performing a new style of dance drama in the dry riverbeds of Kyoto. Despite huge cultural changes since then, it remains the most popular of the traditional styles of Japanese drama.

Its origins can be traced back to Sumer of the third millennium BC, where the Stele of Vultures depicts Eannatum of Lagash, the world's first emperor, wielding a khopesh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A typical khopesh is 50–60 cm (20–24 inches) in length, designed for hooking an opponent's shield or disarming them. The blade is only sharpened on the outside portion of the curved end. The khopesh evolved from the epsilon or similar crescent shaped axes that were used in warfare. Note, however, that the khopesh is not an axe, but rather a slashing weapon like a sabre. Many examples of Khopesh can be found in tombs and many Pharaohs are depicted holding the weapon. Indeed, many examples of khopesh found do not show signs of ever having been sharpened, indicating they were ceremonial, or status symbols.</Text>

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Undisciplined and flighty as one would expect of brigands, Klephts waged an effective guerilla campaign against the much larger and well-armed Ottoman forces sent to subdue them.  Massacres on both sides of the conflict were carried out, but Western European sympathy fell heavily in favor of the Greeks. The unbridled cruelty of the Muslim Ottomans outraged Europe’s citizenry, who raised supplies, food and even soldiers to fight for a Hellenic independence. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After 8 years Ottoman forces had mostly succeeded in crushing the revolt, but where Greek soldiers had failed poets and propaganda had succeeded brilliantly. French, British and Russian governments each sent a fleet in defense of the Greek islands, in response to popular demand for intervention. In the face of such overwhelming force, the Ottomans sued for peace and liberated Greece. After more than 2,000 years under the boots of Macedonians, Romans and Ottomans, The Greek homeland was at last free; unified as one people for the first time in history.

More traditional melee weapons were also used, including wooden daggers, clubs, staves, and paddles.

				The Austrian Landwehr was one of three components that made up the ground forces of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy between 1868 and 1918, and it was composed of recruits from the Cisleithanian parts of the empire. Intended as a national defence force alongside the Hungarian Landwehr, the Austrian Landwehr was officially established by order of Emperor Franz Josef on 5 December 1868. Yet, while the Hungarian force was generously supported early on by the parliament in Budapest, legislators in Vienna generally failed to advance the cause of the Landwehr, leaving it by the 1870s as a skeletal force with only the appearance of parity. [NEWLINE[NEWLINE]The 1880s saw an expansion in the force's numbers, as the high command was unable to obtain increases in manpower for the joint Imperial and Royal army and sought to increase overall numbers through the Landwehr. Additionally, Austrian fears of the development of the Hungarian Landwehr caused the Austrian Reichsrat to vote to increase the Landwehr's strength to 135,000. These nationalist interests led to a gradual strengthening and improvement of the force, so that by the start of the First World War, Landwehr units were considered equal to the units of the joint army in readiness and equipment.

				Longships were a type of ship invented and used by the Norsemen (commonly known as the Vikings) for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. The longship's design evolved over many centuries, beginning in the Stone Age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up until the 6th century with clinker-built ships like Nydam and Kvalsund, appearing in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Longships were particularly notable for their relatively quick speed and light construction. The ships were sturdy and reliable at sea, yet light enough to be carried onto shore or even tipped over as a makeshift shelter for sailors. The ability to move quickly in and out of shore was invaluable during the many raids for which the Vikings would become infamous.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with woven wool sails, and had numerous details and carvings on the hull.

			<Text>A latifundium was an expansive privately owned farm, enormous landed estates specializing in intensive agriculture. The first latifundia were accumulated from the spoils of war, confiscated from conquered peoples beginning in the early 2nd century BC in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy). Latifundia later expanded with conquest, to the Roman provinces of the Maghreb and in Hispania Baetica, in southern Spain.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These estates depended on slave labor and serfs for their productivity, often supplied by the enslavement of the very peoples whose land had been taken. The Latifundia quickly started economic consolidation as larger estates achieved greater economies of scale, enjoyed by the political elite as they did not pay land taxes. Owners re-invested their profits by purchasing smaller neighbouring farms, since smaller farms had a lower productivity and could not compete, in an ancient precursor of agribusiness. As the small farms of the Roman peasantry were bought up by the wealthy and with their vast supply of slaves, the now landless peasantry were forced to find work in the cities of Rome, though often resorting to squatting and handouts.
			[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Latifundia became the template upon which later European nations would base their imperial experiments. The Spanish are most noticeable for patterning the Encomienda system after the late Roman Latifundia.</Text>

Usually associated with a mosque, madrasahs could even specialize in medicine, law, science, philosophy or the education of women. The first madrasah, the Gama'at al-Qarawiyyn, was established in 859 AD by Fatimah al-Fihri, the daughter of a wealthy merchant. During the rule of the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk dynasties, the practice of sponsoring madrasahs by the ruling, wealthy elite spread across Egypt and the Middle East. The first Ottoman madrasah was founded in 1331 AD in Iznik, and followed the traditions of Sunni Islam. The madrasahs of the Turks and Arabs would, as Europe suffered through the Dark Ages, keep the best of Western knowledge alive, and blended it with that of the East.

				The term "monolithic church" (or "rock-hewn church") can be attributed to any church cut from a single stone formation, but is most often used to refer to the complex of 11 churches in Lalibela, Ethiopia. These churches are believed to have been constructed in the 12th century by King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, a devout Christian. This 'New Jerusalem' is situated in a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia, and is an important center of Ethiopian Christianity, pilgrimage and devotion to this day. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Ethiopia boasts many more Monolithic Churches besides those in Lalibela, including many in Tigray. These churches were almost unknown to the outside world until Abba Tewelde Medhin Josief, a Catholic priest, presented a paper to the 1970 International Conference of Ethiopian Studies in which he announced the existence of over 120 rock-hewn churches, 90 of which were still in use. Over the next few years, the total of known churches was raised to 153.

				A pairidaeza is a specific style of garden consisting of cultivated land within an enclosure. Also known as a “paradise garden,” the pairidaeza is thought to originate in the time of the Assyrian Empire. Its rectangular construction serves to contrast the external wildness of nature with an ordered and beautiful garden. Water was often an important element of their construction—ponds, canals, or even fountains flowed freely within the walls.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				As a tool of state, they were invaluable in flaunting a kingdom’s ability to bring life to an area that would otherwise have none. The Achaemenid dynasty melded the pairidaeza with their royal hunting parks, a not so subtle way to show their command over both their empire and the natural world within it.</Text>

				<Text>The Mesoamerican Ball Game, or 'Pitz' is a game of ritual and cultural significance among the Mayan people. The object of the game is to keep the ball in play for as long as possible by striking back and forth within an sloped arena using the hips, though some variations allowed for elbows, shoulders and even rackets. The earliest archaeological evidence of the game come from a court estimated to be 3400 years old.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Over 1300 different ballcourts have been found within Mayan ruins, with relatively little variation in size or layout over thousands of years. Every court is shaped as a narrow alley with gently sloping walls on either side and an enclosed endzone on either side. This gave the court a roughly I-shaped layout. Later versions of the ballcourts include hoops at the midpoint, suspended on the walls. Actually sending a ball through the ring must have been a rare occurrence, since the players could not use their hands or even feet to guide the ball. Moreover, the rings were only slightly larger than the ball itself and were located at no small distance from the playing alley.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			The game was more than a mere sporting event to the Mayan people, perhaps serving as a substitute for war in the case of a dispute between cities. Later Classical Mayan art suggests a link between the ball game and ritual sacrifice, with winners being decapitated as an offering to the gods. The Maya Twin Myth of the Popol Vuh, describes the game between the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, and lord of the underworld, One Death and Seven Death. The game was played so the Hero Twins might recover Hunahpu's head which was being used as a ball by the lords (Hunahpu was using a squash for his head until his real one could be recovered).</Text>

				Towarzysz  Pancerny (Mailed Companion) was a rank of Polish cavalryman from the 10th to 18th century, named for their chainmail armor. During the rule of Mieszko I and Boleslaw I Chrobry in the late 10th century, Pancerni were members of the prince's own force, where their use of mail armor made them unique among the army (druzhyna). [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				With the advent of heavy cavalry the Pancerni often worked in concert with the newer and more heavily armed husaria, augmenting a cavalry charge and chasing down routing enemy soldiers. By the second half of the 17th century, they represented approximately 70% of all soldiers in the Polish military, fighting against Cossacks, Tatars, and the Swedish invasion during the Great Northern War. Once distinct entities, the Husaria and Pancerni were eventually combined to form the ‘Kawaleria Narodowa’, the Polish-Lithuanian National Cavalry. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				Pancerni were organized into companies, with each company consisting of 60 to 200 horsemen. Exceptionally well-armored, they used chainmail or platemail armor for upper body, vambraces, helmets, and buckler shields. The most common armaments were sabres, reflex bows and, with the arrival of gunpowder, flintlock pistols and carbines.

				One of the most ancient of seaworthy boat designs, the prau, also known as proa or perahu, are wooden sailing vessels consisting of a large hull (vaka) and a small hull (ama) set in parallel by a crossbeam (akas). Prau are believed to have been developed in Micronesia in the first century AD, spreading quickly throughout southeast Asia. Western accounts of prau first appear in the 16th century, when Magellan made note of their agility in his fateful trip to the Philippines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When sailing in strong winds, the crew walk between the hulls along the akas to counterbalance the force of the sail. A skilled prau crew can balance so as to lift the ama out of the water, called "flying the ama", and skim the ocean's surface to reach incredible speeds. Prau continue to be used worldwide, and modern designs can exceed 95km/h in favourable winds. This makes prau some of the fastest ships in the world; not bad for a 2,000 year old!

				Unlike many other tribes, the Iroquois had easy access to trade goods at Dutch posts along the Hudson River, and traded for various goods and luxuries. Weapons of war, such as the iron axe and musket, were highly sought after, and by the 1640s the Iroquois were well-equipped to fight their traditional Huron and Algonquian enemies. Common muskets were given in exchange for pelts and food, but often of lighter and smaller caliber than military-grade muskets. The British feared giving high-quality weapons to people who could turn against them, but the Iroquois often found the smaller weapons more suitable to rough terrain anyways. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				War tactics were changed after the Iroquois' acquisition of firearms. The lethality of their new weapons put the Iroquois, never a highly populous group, in a precarious position. The tribes' custom of absorbing refugees and prisoners of war changed as fewer and fewer warriors survived clashes with European arms. Great armies walking with prominent chiefs and shamans were replaced with guerilla tactics, small bands of troops guided by commanders.

			<Text>Criminal justice in Songhai was based mainly, if not entirely, on Islamic principles, especially during the rule of Askia Muhammad. The local qadis were tasked with maintaining order by following Sharia law, found in the precepts of the Qur'an and the hadiths. Kings usually did not judge a defendant, however, under special circumstances, such as acts of treason, they felt an obligation to do so and thus exert their authority. Results of a trial were announced by the "town crier" and punishment for most trivial crimes usually consisted of confiscation of merchandise or imprisonment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Askia Muhammad centralized the administration of the empire and established an efficient bureaucracy which was responsible for, among other things, tax collection and the administration of justice. Qadis worked at the local level and were positioned in important trading towns, such as Timbuktu and Djenne. The Qadi was appointed by the king and dealt with common-law misdemeanors according to Sharia law.</Text>

			<Text>Qizilbash was originally a pejorative for the followers of the Safawiyyah Sufi order, who distinguished themselves by wearing bright crimson headwear. The name, which means red headed, became a mark of pride among the Qizilbash, who organized into a Shi'ite Islamic military society in the late 15th century. Though primarily of Turkman origin, the Qizilbash proved instrumental in the establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in Iran.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			In a campaign to avenge the death of his father Haydar, Ismail I, led 7000 Qizilbash warriors to destroy the Aq Qoyunlu force of 30 000 in Azerbaijan, and establish the Safavid State. By 1510, eleven years later, Ismail brought all of Iran under his control, the first ethnically Iranian monarch to unify Iran in over 850 years. Though they had made him a powerful king, Ismail feared the power and influence of the tribal qizilbash over the Iranian peoples. Ismail and his successors would spend the next 80 years diminishing the political power of the Qizilbash, replacing them with ghulam slave soldiers from the Caucasus. Nevertheless, the Qizilbash held an honoured position within the Safavid empire, both on the battlefield and in the Safavid court.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				According to oral tradition, the five tribes of the Iroquois devoted much energy toward fighting and killing each other until the 1500s. It was at this time that the five tribes united into a powerful confederation, forming an elaborate political system including a bicameral (two-house) legislature much like the modern U.S. Congress. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In accordance with their unwritten constitution, the confederacy was represented by 50 delegates, or Sachems – all men, each chosen by the clan mother. The 17 sachems from the Seneca and Mohawk tribes met in one house while the 19 Oneida and Cayuga met in the other. The 14 Onondaga sachems acted as tie-breakers and had the power to veto decisions made by the others. In addition to Sachem, who met on Onondaga land to cast their votes, there were advisory council members called Pine Trees. Pine Trees could be men or women appointed for their heroic feats and accomplishments. In 1715 the Tuscarora joined the league, and it was renamed the League of Six Nations. Benjamin Franklin’s dealings with the Iroquois led him to model the United States’ government after theirs. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
					“The soil of the earth from one end of the land to the other is the property of the people who inhabit it. By birthright the Ongwehonweh (original beings) are the owners of the soil which they own and occupy and none other may hold it. The same law has been held from the oldest times. The Great Creator has made us of the one blood and of the same soil he made us and as only different tongues constitute different nations he established different hunting grounds and territories and made boundary lines between them...” [NEWLINE]

				Scythed chariots are modified war chariots with long blades extending from the wheel axels. Though often dismissed as fanciful storytelling, the use of these war machines has been confirmed in at least a few more credible sources. Scythed chariots featured prominently during the Greco-Persian War, though to little effect against Macedon's well-trained infantry. Use of scythed chariots has been ascribed to Pictish, Irish and Iceni armies, but the claims are often of dubious validity. The only report of a scythed chariot in Britain outside of Roman propaganda comes from the Irish Ulster Cycle, during the adventures of Chu Chulainn. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Although chariots had fallen out of use in continental Europe from the end of the 3rd century BC, Caesar found that they remained significant in British warfare. Caesar encountered both Celtic cavalry and chariots and described how these warriors would throw javelins from their vehicles before dismounting to fight on foot. Celtic soldiers could return to their chariots to quickly retreat or redeploy. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				“They make war not only on horseback but also from two horse chariots and cars armed in the Gallic fashion – they call them Covinni - on which they use axles equipped with scythes.” [NEWLINE]

			<Text>
				The strength and ferocity of the tribal Germanic warriors, or Slaganz, were legendary among Roman writers and soldiers alike. Germanic tribesmen stood an average of 6 inches taller than a Latin, but were unable to capitalize on their brute advantages over Roman interlopers because of the legions' superior equipment, organization and training. German fortunes would change, however, under the leadership of Arminius.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] 
				A Cherusci commander who had spent time training under the Romans, Arminius led a coalition of five German tribes in a decisive victory, destroying three Roman legions under Publius Varus. Arminius falisified reports of a northern Germanic uprising and laid an ambush for Varus deep in the Teotoburg Forest. Using their superior numbers, heavy rain, and Arminius' knowledge of Roman tactics, the Roman annihilation at Teotoburg Forest was utterly thorough. It is estimated that 20 000 men were killed or enslaved by the Germans. Rome's total defeat at the hands of Arminius set the borders of Rome's eastern expansion at the Rhine, and would be remembered as their greatest humiliation.

Jonow became part of their master's clan, and were often freed after a certain amount of years.

			<Text>World War I saw rapid technological and tactical changes in how wars were fought, not the least of which was the first use of aircraft for scouting, support, and bombing. These new machines opened an entirely new theatre of war, a new avenue to gain an advantage over the enemy. Despite their promise, the first aircraft were slow, clumsy, and unreliable thanks to their underpowered combustion engines. This all changed in 1915 when Marc Birgikt invented a new V8 engine boasting 150 horsepower and weighing only 330 pounds. The French high command saw this new motor''s obvious value as an aircraft engine and set about in commissioning a new fighter aircraft designed around this new powerhouse: The Societe Pour L'Aviation et ses Derives, or "SPAD" S. VII. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				By late 1916 SPAD VIIs were beginning to see action, and saw wide adoption by allied pilots for the rest of the war. Though lacking in maneuverability compared to the older Nieuport fighters, the SPAD VII more than made up for this deficiency in sheer speed, travelling in excess of 205kmph, and capable of safe dives of more than 400kmph. Entirely new tactics had to be created by pilots to leverage this unmatched speed, which gave the SPAD the ability to safely avoid or escape pitched battles. The added stability in diving was especially appreciated over the old Nieuports, which had a bad habit of shedding their wings during maneuvers. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Air superiority became a constant arms race against newer and better German designs and engines. By the end of the war, the SPAD VII's single .303 Vickers machine gun was outmatched by German fighters, which carried at least two machine guns. The heavier and faster SPAD XIII replaced the SPAD VII by late 1917, and would carry France to the end of the War. Though at times unreliable and hard to maneuver, the SPAD series would go down in history as the fastest and most powerful of WWI fighters, and continued to be used by the French as a training plane until it was retired in 1928.

At a minimum,  Tambos would contain housing, cooking facilities, and storage silos called qullqas, which contained everything from food to building materials.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Beyond taking care of various kinds of travelers, larger tambos would also contain facilities where various specialists, such as potters and weavers, would produce their goods. They could also served as administrative centers from which local lords would oversee the region. Additionally, coca production and exploitation was often carried within a safe distance of the Tambo, providing protection to the Incan coca monopoly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Tambos were frequently positioned for interregional contact and travel, as opposed to being positioned near large local villages.

				The Turkish word 'Tersane' is derived from the Venetian 'darsane', from which the English word 'arsenal' is also derived. Though never at the forefront of shipbuilding technology, the Ottomans enjoyed over a century of naval dominance in the Mediterranean following their conquest of Constantinople in 1453. The largest Tersane, constructed at the Golden Horn across from Constantinople, housed over 160 docks, drydocks, storehouses and supply depots, making it one of the largest centers of trade, commerce and industry in the Mediterranean. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Ottoman naval power was maintained through its tremendous shipbuilding capacity, as well as its allegiances to the Barbary corsairs of North Africa. This pre-eminence was finally ended at the battle of Lepanto, where a combined Spanish and Venetian armada delivered a crushing defeat to the Ottoman's, capturing or destroying more than two thirds of the Ottoman's navy. Their response was to build 250 new vessels within six months. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

			<Text>
				The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, more commonly known as the Teutonic Order, is a Catholic knightly order founded in 1190 in Acre Jerusalem. Originally founded as an adjunct of the Knights Hospitaller, the Order was commissioned to help pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land and establish hospitals for the many Germanic pilgrims who spoke neither the local languages, nor Latin. Within 50 years, the German Catholic order became a state unto itself, prosecuting a holy crusade against Baltic pagans from their capital in present day Malbork, Poland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] 
				After Christian forces were expelled from Jerusalem, the Teutonic knights found work as mercenaries and guardsmen in Transylvania, Hungary, and then Poland, before becoming the largest player in a new Prussian Crusade against the pagan inhabitants of the Eastern Baltics. The Teutonic Order carried out a bloody and centuries long campaign of forced conversions and ethnic replacement which saw them come into conflict with Estonians, Lithuanians, Old Prussians and even their former Polish allies. Struggles against the militarized Christianization by Catholic knights would shape the national identities of all neighboring peoples.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Christianization of Lithuania and Poland's successful attempts to politically isolate the Teutonic Order from the rest of Catholicism left the Order without a purpose (and a shortage of friends) by 1520. In response, the Grand Master of the Order, Albert of Brandenburg, resigned from the Order, converted to Lutheranism and styled himself Duke of Prussia, becoming the first Protestant state by converting the Order's Prussian holdings into a secularized fiefdom. Though declining in political force, the Teutonic Order continued to exist as a Catholic state through its holdings in Germany until forcibly dissolved by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1809. Since then, the Teutonic Order has continued to exist, but as a ceremonial and charitable organization.

				"Tophet" is a Hebrew term for a place of worship and human sacrifice to the Canaanite gods, and has become a colorful synonym for hell within Judeo-Christian theology. Usually located outside cities, Tophets were holy places where sacrifices to the gods could be presented to the heads of the Phoenician pantheon, Ba'al Hammon, the god of weather and vegetation, and his consort, Tanit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Regular sacrifices were made to ensure the prosperity of Carthage. After the ceremony, ashes of the burnt offering were placed within a vessel and stones were placed on top of the funerary urns to seal them within the Tophet. Child sacrifice, once prevalent throughout the Near-East, was a persistent hallmark of Carthaginian religious life long after contemporary cultures had shunned the practice. Modern archaeological evidence suggests children were sacrificed in times of great stress such as wars, plagues, and natural disasters as an act of divine supplication.

				Waag ("weigh house") are the public buildings in which goods were weighed for market. Prior to international standards of weights and measures, the Waags performed an indispensable service in preventing the fraudulent sale of goods. As public control of the weight of goods was very important, Waags were run by local authorities who would also use them for the levying of taxes on goods transported through or sold within the city. This necessitated weigh houses be near a market square or town centre.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Of particular note is the Amsterdam Waag, built in the 15th-century on Nieuwmarkt square in Amsterdam. Originally, the building was one of the gates in the city wall along the moat formed by the current Singel canal. A number of guilds were housed on the top floors of the building: the blacksmiths' guild, the painter's guild, the masons' guild and the surgeons' guild, each with its own entrance gate. In 1632 Rembrandt van Rijn was commissioned to paint the surgeons at work, and the resulting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp made his reputation. In 1691 a theatrum anatomicum was added, which became famous for admitting members of the public to witness human dissections.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The Xiafan Guanjun (lit. "The Foreign Expeditionary Armada") was the great treasure fleet of the Ming Dynasty. Seven voyages were made from 1405 to 1433 AD, all headed by the legendary admiral Zheng He at the behest of Yongle Emperor. The Treasure Fleet ranged as far as the Arabian Peninsula in their task of projecting Chinese influence across the South China Sea and beyond, bringing many smaller nations under the suzerainty of China.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				
				The ships of the Xiafan Guanjun were some of the largest wooden ships ever constructed, some measuring an estimated 137 meters (416 feet). It would be another century before European ships could match the size and power of the Chinese, making China the undisputed naval superpower of the 15th century. Despite this raw power, the voyages were primarily concerned with diplomacy, bringing envoys and even kings before the emperor to present tribute and perform the 'kowtow', an act of reverence indicating their recognition and subservience to China.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				
				"As an engine for carrying man and his commerce upon the high and stormy seas as well as on the vast inland waterways, it is doubtful if any class of vessel… is more suited or better adapted to its purpose than the Chinese or Indian junk, and it is certain that for flatness of sail and handiness, the Chinese rig is unsurpassed."[NEWLINE]-H.

				The Yamato-class battleships were battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) constructed and operated during World War II. Displacing 72,000 long tons (73,000 t) at full load, the vessels were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed. The class carried the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship, nine 460-millimetre (18.1 in) naval guns, each capable of firing 1,360 kg (3,000 lb) shells over 42 km (26 mi). Two battleships of the class (Yamato and Musashi) were completed, while a third (Shinano) was converted to an aircraft carrier during construction. All were sunk by American forces during WWII.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			
				Due to their size, speed, and power, The Yamato-class visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the western powers, especially the United States. One of the reasons that the warship may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word "Yamato" was often used as a poetic name for Japan itself. Thus, the construction and subsequent destruction of the Yamato battleships could serve as a metaphor for the rise and fall of Japanese imperial aspirations.

				Yassa was a secret written code of law created by Genghis Khan. The word Yassa translates into "order" or "decree". It was the de facto law of the Mongol Empire even though the "law" was never actually made public. The Yassa seems to have originated from decrees issued in war time, and was later codified and expanded to include cultural and life-style conventions. By keeping the Yassa secret, the decrees could be modified and used selectively. It is believed that the Yassa was supervised by Genghis Khan himself with the help of the high judge of the Mongol Empire: His stepbrother, Shihihutag. Genghis Khan appointed his second son Chagatai (later Chagatai Khan) to oversee the execution of the laws.

				Yellow Brows (Ohamupe) were one of two military societies within the Shoshone, playing an integral role in hunting, scouting, and policing within their Shoshone bands. Yellow Brow braves would keep their heads shaved into a cockscomb 'mohawk', and paint their exposed heads yellow, hence their common English name. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Yellow Brows were composed of only the bravest and most daring of the young men, tasked with keeping order on hunting expeditions, scouting, and soldiering. The Society was never more than a few hundred young men, and membership was through appointment by graduating members, who would elect their replacement. A young Yellow Brow was expected to act and speak in a contrarian way as a sign of membership.  For instance, when asked if he would like to join the Yellow Brows, it was expected that the young man would say 'No' as a sign of willingness to join, or 'Yes' if he wished to decline. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In battle, they were led by a warchief who carried a long cane tipped with a stone or metal dagger.  The cane was used to grab and unhorse opponents, or as a No-Retreat signal. If the enemy was gaining the upper hand, the chief would drive his staff into the ground and the braves would defend him to the last. Yellow Brows were banned from leaving their chief's side until another member of the tribe came and pulled out the staff, releasing the braves from their charge. Fleeing battle after the staff had been planted resulted in dire consequences for any returning Yellow Brow. Such dishonorable conduct was met with abject mockery and banishment from the tribe.
